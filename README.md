build-snap.

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed
to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the
software compilation process using simple platform and compiler
independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles
and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of
your choice.
This snap is maintained separately from the CMake project by one
of the CMake co-maintainers. Visit https://crascit.com for additional
CMake resources, including the book Professional CMake: A Practical Guide
and various blog articles.
